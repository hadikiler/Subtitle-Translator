00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,440
In the last video, you
saw one visualization of

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,100
the cost function J
of w or J of w, b.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,885
Let's look at some further

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,060
richer visualizations
so that you can get

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,650
an even better intuition

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,125
about what the cost
function is doing.

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,270
Here is what we've seen so far.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,665
There's the model, the
model's parameters w and b,

9
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:25,725
the cost function J of w and b,

10
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,410
as well as the goal
of linear regression,
